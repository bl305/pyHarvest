# pyHarvest
This is part of my project "giving back to the community" - free to use.
Python tool for harvesting interesting information from files, including limited discovery of files
You can find my project also on my website: http://itfanatic.com

Where sourcecode of someone else has been used, it is always referenced in my sourcecode. As much as possible. 
If someting is missing, please sugest me ASAP.

Tasks planned next:
SMB module implement size, name and depth limits
patternmatch module add more patterns
ERROR/Exception handling in many-many cases...I didn't pay much attention to this
Integrate the discovery module with Analysis module (not sure about this yet)
DB module, match Files database to Analysis database
